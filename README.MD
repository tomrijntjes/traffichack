Based on the 2017 report we should at least include:

- vehicle type (note: pedestrians are not included in the set)
- age group
- road type
- speed limit
- road conditions (dry or wet)


TODO:
- address imbalance
- implement correct accuracy metric
- address joining issue: multiple vehicles in an accident
